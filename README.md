# Pragmateam code challenge client (React)

Please refer to the provided document for the code challenge requirements. 

## Available scripts

- `npm start` - Start the application (Port 3000)
- `npm test` - Runs available tests

## Improvements
- Beer list moved to a separate component.
- Data is moved to a separate file.
- Unit tests are added and packaged inside the components.

## Future Improvements
- API call will be moved to service package. As of now only one API call and therefore it is in the component itself.
- Add suspense component while loading.
- Errors will be handled to display Error dialog box.
- Improve UI/UX standards. 

## Note
- beerData.test.js is added just for the test coverage
